# Prompts Package

This package stores versioned prompt templates used by future AI features.

## Versioning strategy

- Keep prompts as plain text/markdown files in folders grouped by domain.
- Use semantic versioning in filename suffixes (e.g. `lesson-summary.v1.md`).
- Any prompt behavior change should include changelog notes in this README.
